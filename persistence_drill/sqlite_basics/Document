Understanding Transactions and ACID Properties

1. What are Transactions?
A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. These operations must either all succeed together or all fail together, ensuring the database remains consistent.

Example: Transferring money from one bank account to another involves withdrawing from one account and depositing into another. Both must happen; if one fails, the entire transaction should be canceled.


2. What are ACID Properties?
ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability — key properties that guarantee reliable transaction processing.

Atomicity: The whole transaction happens, or none of it happens.

Consistency: The database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.

Isolation: Concurrent transactions do not affect each other’s operations.

Durability: Once a transaction commits, its changes are permanent, even in case of a crash.

3. Suppose You Do Not Have Transactions. Is That System Useful? Why?
Without transactions, the system cannot guarantee data integrity during multiple operations. For example:

If money is withdrawn but not deposited in the transfer example, money disappears.

Partial updates can corrupt data, causing inconsistent or incorrect results.

Such a system is risky and generally not useful for critical applications like banking, inventory management, etc.

4. What Properties Does Your File System Have?
Most file systems provide:

Durability: Data saved to disk remains even after power loss.

Basic Consistency: Files have a defined structure.

Limited Atomicity: Some file systems support atomic write operations but usually not complex multi-step transactions.

No Isolation: Multiple users writing to the same file can cause conflicts without explicit locking.

No full ACID compliance like a database system.

5. Suppose You Do Not Have "A" in ACID (Atomicity). What Happens? When Is It OK?
Without Atomicity:

Partial transactions can happen.

Example: If you transfer money but the withdrawal succeeds and the deposit fails, money is lost.

When is it OK?

For non-critical operations or idempotent actions (repeated actions don’t cause issues).

Example: Logging user activity where partial loss is acceptable.

6. Suppose You Do Not Have "C" in ACID (Consistency). What Happens? When Is It OK?
Without Consistency:

Database may enter invalid states.

Example: Bank account balance can become negative if rules aren’t enforced.

When is it OK?

Systems where eventual consistency is acceptable, like social media timelines.

Example: Facebook posts may appear out of order briefly but get corrected later.

7. Suppose You Do Not Have "I" in ACID (Isolation). What Happens? When Is It OK?
Without Isolation:

Concurrent transactions interfere.

Example: Two users booking the last seat at the same time, causing double booking.

When is it OK?

Systems prioritizing speed over perfect isolation.

Example: Analytics systems where some data overlap is tolerable.

8. Suppose You Do Not Have "D" in ACID (Durability). What Happens? When Is It OK?
Without Durability:

Committed transactions may be lost on crash.

Example: After payment confirmation, if system crashes, payment info may vanish.

When is it OK?

Systems where data loss is acceptable or data can be reconstructed.

Example: Cache systems or temporary session data.
