#📁 Level 0 – Basic Script (No Abstraction)
Description:
This is a simple, one-purpose Python script to read from standard input, clean and transform each line to uppercase, and print it to standard output.

How it works:

Reads stdin line by line

Strips leading/trailing whitespace

Converts to uppercase

Prints each line

Usage:
Run the script and provide input via stdin:

bash
Copy code
python process.py < input.txt
Constraints:

Everything is top-down sequential

No functions, no abstraction

Only built-in Python tools are used

Example Input:

hello world
This is a test
PyCharm + WSL

Example Output:
HELLO WORLD
THIS IS A TEST
PYCHARM + WSL
