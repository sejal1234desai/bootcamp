üìò Level 4 ‚Äì Stream Processing and Stateful Processors
Welcome to Level 4 of your pipeline abstraction journey! This level transforms your system from simple, stateless string processors to a stream-based processing engine capable of handling real-world data complexity through:

Streaming

Stateful logic

Fan-in/Fan-out

Reusability of earlier processors

üöÄ What‚Äôs New in Level 4
‚úÖ Streaming Interface
Processors now handle streams of lines:

python
Copy code
from typing import Iterator

def process(lines: Iterator[str]) -> Iterator[str]:
    ...
This shift enables:

Emitting zero, one, or many lines per input

Maintaining internal state across lines

Composing more complex transformations

üîß Key Features
üß† Stateful Processors
Processors can now remember information across lines (e.g., counters, buffers).

üîÄ Fan-in and Fan-out
Fan-in: Combine multiple lines into one (e.g., join_pairs)

Fan-out: Split one line into many (e.g., splitter)

‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Initialization
Processors accept parameters like min_length=5 via configuration injection.

‚ôªÔ∏è Legacy Support via Decorators
You can reuse existing str -> str processors by wrapping them:

python
Copy code
@stream_adapter
def to_upper(line: str) -> str:
    return line.upper()
üõ† Folder Structure
bash
Copy code

‚öóÔ∏è Example Processors
line_counter.py (stateful)
Prefixes each line with its line number.

join_pairs.py (fan-in)
Combines every two lines into one.

splitter.py (fan-out)
Splits a line into words (or by delimiter).

upper.py and snake.py (stateless)
Transform text to uppercase or snake_case.

üîß Config File (pipeline.yaml)
yaml
Copy code
pipeline:
  - name: line_counter
    type: processors.line_counter.LineCounter

  - name: splitter
    type: processors.splitter.LineSplitter
    config:
      delimiter: " "

  - name: upper
    type: processors.upper.to_upper
‚úÖ Implementation Checklist
 All processors now use Iterator[str] -> Iterator[str]

 Decorator to wrap legacy str -> str functions

 At least one stateful processor (e.g., LineCounter)

 At least one processor with fan-in or fan-out

 Config injection to processors

 Unit tests for processors

 Works with unchanged pipeline.yaml

üß™ Testability
Each processor can be tested independently using standard Python unit tests.

python
Copy code
from processors.line_counter import LineCounter

def test_line_counter():
    lines = iter(["hello", "world"])
    processor = LineCounter()
    output = list(processor.process(lines))
    assert output == ["1: hello", "2: world"]
‚è≠Ô∏è What's Next
Level 5: DAG-based dynamic routing with tagged output

Flexible pipelines where each line can take its own path

Real-world routing logic based on content or type
