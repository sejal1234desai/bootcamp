# Operation: Avoid Overloading Meaning for Variables

# Bad practice: Using generic variable names
data = [1, 2, 3]
temp = [4, 5, 6]

# Improved with specific variable names
user_scores = [1, 2, 3]
product_ratings = [4, 5, 6]

# Output:
# Using meaningful names like `user_scores` and `product_ratings` clarifies the context.
