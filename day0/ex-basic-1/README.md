# ex-basics-1


Welcome to the **ex-basics-1** project! This is a simple application that demonstrates basic Python programming concepts and usage of the `uv` tool. The exercise involves setting up a project using `uv`, creating a virtual environment, and writing a module to greet the user by name or say "Hello, world!" by default.

## Task Description

For this task, I was required to:

1. **Initialize an application** using "uv init".
2. **Create a virtual environment** with "uv venv" and activate it.
3. **Set up the IDE** to use the virtual environment I created.
4. **Create a module** named "<yourname>-hello" and write code that says hello to the argument passed, or to "world" by default.
