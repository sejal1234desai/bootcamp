ex-tool-1: Web Server Setup on GCP
1. I created a virtual machine (VM) instance on Google Cloud Platform using the Compute Engine.
2. Chose Ubuntu as the OS while setting up the VM.
3. Connected to the VM using SSH through the GCP console.
4. Installed Python3 .
5. Created a directory named site and added an index.html file that contains my name and a photo.
I hosted the website on my GCP VM. You can access it using the link below:
