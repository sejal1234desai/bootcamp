📚 What I Learned Today:
- How to use MkDocs and the Material theme to build documentation sites.
- The structure and purpose of files like README.md, design-doc.md, and login-flow.md.
- Mermaid syntax for creating sequence diagrams in Markdown.
- Importance of writing clear and simple documentation for your projects.

🤔 What Confused Me:
- At first, it was unclear where each Markdown file should be placed.
- Mermaid syntax was new, especially the sequenceDiagram format.
- Unsure whether I had to recreate README.md or just move it.

💡 How I Resolved It:
- Asked questions and reviewed instructions.
- Practiced by creating simple diagrams first.
- Verified file structure inside the "docs/" folder and used "mkdocs serve" to test.

🧠 Summary:
Today was productive. I understood how to structure project documentation and started seeing the value of writing docs alongside code. It’s not just about writing—it’s about explaining ideas clearly.

📌 Next Goals:
- Update diagrams with more complex flows.
- Improve design-doc with more detailed options and tradeoffs.
- Add more pages like FAQs or Troubleshooting.
